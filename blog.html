<p>
Overall I didn't run into too many challenges with this assignment. I had some experience with HTML before so it was fairly easy to create the pages with HTML. I also didn't have any real trouble with git and github or publishing my html files to my Oregon State Web Space. Overall it was a fairly easy assignment. I found that Piazza was useful for finding answers to any questions I had, as typically another student had already asked the question and other students had answered the questions. This made it easy to find answers to questions particularly related to posting my files to my web space. I also found the lecture information to be useful. I think the assignment was useful for making sure we know how to use git properly as well as making sure we can post our files onto our web space properly.
